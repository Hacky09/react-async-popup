react-async-popup provides two components `Modal` and `Confirm`.

To use Modal or Confirm, new method must be called, it takes an optional paramater.

```tsx
const callbacks = await Confirm.new()
```

```tsx
const callbacks = await Modal.new()
```

## new method

The new method returns a promise, which gets resolved with an object, which has two methods `show`, `destroy`.

```tsx
const { show, destroy } = await Confirm.new(config)
```

- show method to opens the modal/config
- destroy method destroys the instance

`new` method takes a config object as parameter which can have following values -

| Tables         |                    type                     |                                       default                                        |                              description                              |

### show method

Makes the Modal/Confirm visible to the user, it returns a promise, by default promise resolves with `true` on ok and with `false` on cancel.

_`show` method also takes a config object as perameter, value of the config is same as `new` method
just `destroyOnClose` and `container` properties are not available here._

Value of `show` parameter can override the initial values given to the `new` method,
this is really usefull when developer wan't to use single instance in more then one context.

```tsx

async function onDelete() {

    const { show } = await Confirm.new();

    const result = await show({
      title: ' Are you sure you want to delete the file ?'
    });

    if (result === false) {
      return;
    }
    ...
  }
```

<span style='color: red; font-weight: bold;'>
  Show method can also resolve with user provided value -
</span>

**
`content` and `footer` components provided in the config of new or show method will receive
`ok` and `cancel` callback methods as props/paramater.
The value provided to these methods will be used to resolve the promise returned by `show` method.
**

### destroy method

The destroy method destroys the instance, it returns a promise which resolves without any value.

** Once destroyed the `show` method will always resolve with `null` value. **
